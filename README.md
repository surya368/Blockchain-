The limitations of centralized file transfer systems in providing the necessary 
distributed trust and transparency essential for collaborative operations. 
Recognizing the potential of blockchain technology to address these challenges, 
the paper proposes a novel blockchain-based secure file transfer system tailored for consortiums.
Key elements of the proposed system include leveraging Hyperledger Fabric, a robust enterprise 
blockchain framework, for establishing the blockchain network and implementing smart contracts. 
Additionally, the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) is employed for decentralized file storage, 
ensuring data is distributed across the network for enhanced security and availability.
The paper elucidates the workflow for identity management and file-sharing processes within the 
proposed system, emphasizing the importance of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in
facilitating secure information exchange among consortium members.
By offering a comprehensive solution that integrates blockchain technology 
with decentralized file storage, the proposed system aims to address the inherent limitations 
of centralized systems while enabling consortiums of organizations to collaborate securely and transparently. 
This research not only contributes to advancing the field of blockchain applications but also offers practical 
insights for enhancing collaborative operations among organizations.
